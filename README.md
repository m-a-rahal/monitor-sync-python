# Introduction

Monitors make synchronization so easy and less prone to bugs. Sadly, I couldn't find any implementation for them in python on the internet (at least not in the first google search page üòù).  
turns out, not only is it possible, but it's really simple and so powerful !  
  
So, in this tutorial, I'll show a way I found to easily implement and use them  
hope you find it useful

# Monitor class

this is the main class, we'll just inherit from it to make life easier:

```python
import threading

class Monitor(object):
    def __init__(self, lock = threading.Lock()):
        ''' initializes the _lock, threading.Lock() is used by default '''
        self._lock = lock


    def Condition(self):
        ''' returns a condition bound to this monitor's lock'''
        return threading.Condition(self._lock)

    init_lock = __init__
```

## How to define a monitor

```python
class My_Monitor_Class(Monitor):
    def __init__(self):
        self.init_lock()

# or pass your own lock

class My_Monitor_Class(Monitor):
    def __init__(self, lock):
        self.init_lock(lock)
```

simple, we just inherit form the `Monitor` class, just don't forget call `self.init_lock()`

## Monitor 'Condition' objects

```python
class My_Monitor_Class(Monitor):
    def __init__(self):
        self.init_lock(lock)
        cond1 = self.Condition()
```

this creates a 'Condition' object bound to this monitor's lock

conditions are objects that implement the famous `wait()` and `notify()` methods_(see their doc: _<https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#condition-objects>_)_

## Monitor methods

to add a method, you should protect the a method using the monitor's lock

```python
class My_Monitor_Class(Monitor):
    def method(self):
        with self._lock:
            # your code here
```

### Caution ‚ö†

if you want to define **private methods** that are only called inside a monitor, you should either:

1- use the monitor with an `RLock` _(see this helpful link about R-Locks: _<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16567958/when-and-how-to-use-pythons-rlock>_)_

2- define these methods as hidden, and don't use lock in them

```python
class My_Monitor_Class(Monitor):
    def _method(self): #leading underscore (_) to indicate it's a private method
        # your code here
```

3- or maybe other solutions ‚Ä¶ you can get creative

# Entrance and Exit protocols

usually, monitors provide 'entrance' and 'exit' protocols to entering a critical section.

**Example:**

```python
monitor.enter_protocol()
<critical section>
monitor.exit_protocol()
```

in this case, it's really more useful to define the entrance and exit protocol methods as follows:

```python
class monitor(Monitor):
    def __enter__(self):
        with self._lock:
            # enter_protocol code here

    def __exit__(self, type, value, traceback):
        with self._lock:
            # exit_protocol code here
```

now, the syntax becomes simpler and safer !

```python
with monitor:
    <critical section>
```

the 'with' keyword ensures the **exit** method is ALWAYS called, no matter what (exception, return, break, ‚Ä¶ etc). So use this whenever you have the chance to. After all, the purpose of monitors is to make the code simpler and less prone to bugs

# That's it
